            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              Bob Marley was born in the rural village of Nine Mile in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, 
              to Norval Sinclair Marley, a white Jamaican of English descent, and Cedella Malcolm, 
              a black Jamaican. Growing up in the impoverished community of Trench Town in Kingston, 
              Bob experienced firsthand the struggles of Jamaica's urban poor, which would later 
              deeply influence his music and message.

              black man's side nor the white man's side. Me dip on God's side, the one who create me

            <h3>The Birth of The Wailers</h3>
            <p>
              In 1963, at just 18 years old, Bob Marley formed The Wailers with childhood friends 
              Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer (Neville Livingston). The group was mentored by Joe Higgs, 
              a respected local musician who taught them harmony and guitar. Their first single, 
              "Simmer Down," became a Jamaican hit in 1964, marking the beginning of Bob's 
              legendary musical journey.

            <h3>From Ska to Reggae</h3>
            <p>
              The Wailers began their career during the ska era but evolved their sound through 
              rocksteady and into what would become known as reggae. Bob's distinctive vocal style, 
              combined with his spiritual lyrics and the group's innovative rhythms, helped define 
              the reggae genre. Their music became a vehicle for social commentary, spiritual 
              awakening, and cultural pride.

            <h3>Spiritual Awakening</h3>
            <p>
              In the late 1960s, Bob Marley embraced Rastafarianism, a religious and cultural 
              movement that profoundly influenced his music and worldview. This spiritual journey 
              brought themes of African identity, social justice, and unity to the forefront of 
              his songs. His dreadlocks became a symbol of his faith, and his music became a 
              means of spreading Rastafarian philosophy worldwide.
